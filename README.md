# Hello! My name is Cindy Qian.

I'm a first year student at the University of Washingtonâ€”Seattle and am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area. Although I'm still exploring different fields of study, I know that my passions revolve around technology, media, and communications. 

In the future, I hope to find a way to combine my interests and be able to bring people and society together through my work. I currently plan to major in either CS or Informatics.
